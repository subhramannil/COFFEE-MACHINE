# COFFEE-MACHINE
This project is a simple coffee machine simulator built using Python. It allows users to order different types of coffee, check available resources, and manage the inventory of ingredients. The coffee machine can prepare three types of coffee: Espresso, Latte, and Cappuccino, each with its own ingredient requirements and cost.
